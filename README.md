# Discord-Bot
<pre>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

Discord channels and telegram groups are major forms of communication when communication between a large set of people is involved. These are not only used for unofficial communication but are also used for official communication these days. 

Having said that it would be really difficult for admins to manage all the users by answering all of their queries as they could be repetitive (most common queries) 

Hence to reduce the effort of the managers or the admins it would be helpful if they find an alternative to answer those kind of queries 

A Bot can act as the best solution in this case 

<h2>Design and Methodology</h2>

We intend to design a discord bot to solve this issue 

The reason for choosing discord is that whatsapp has a limitation of how many members can be added in a group but discord doesnâ€™t have any such 

Also in terms of privacy, for someone to be on whatsapp or have an account on whatsapp they should share their mobile number. But discord just displays username to others using it unlike whatsapp and telegram which directly displays the mobile number publicly 

 

To design a discord bot, we need to create a server on discord along with which we create a bot and generate token to access the control of the bot 

We choose all the controls that the bot can have on the server in the options designated
